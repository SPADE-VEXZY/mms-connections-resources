# Project Notice

This project is **strictly for testing deployment workflows** (Docker, CI/CD, hosting environments, etc.).

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer
- **I did not develop this project manually.**
- The code was **generated entirely by AI** for the purpose of testing deployments.
- **Please do not judge code quality** or blame for any bugs, errors, or unconventional patterns.
- This repository **is not intended for production use** or as an example of best practices.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Testing server configurations  
- Testing deployment pipelines  
- Verifying build processes  
- Experimenting with various technologies  

## 📝 Notes
If you encounter errors, issues, or weird code — that’s expected.  
The goal is to test deployment, **not** to build a polished application.
